# AI-VirtualPainter

This project was created as a part of Hand Tracking course from CV Zone. 
The main goal of this project is to create a AI enabled mini tool which allows us to paint different colors on display using Python, OpenCV. 
Hands module from the Google's Mediapipe was used to detect landmarks on hand, and simple math to calculate the distances, identify fingers, and draw accross the display.
